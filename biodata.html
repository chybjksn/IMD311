        Hello everyone, Assalamualaikum, and have a wonderful day! <br> 
        You may all refer to me as Aqila and my full name is Nur Aqila binti Reduan. <br>
        Since my birthday is June 28th 2002, this year marks my 21st year of life. <br>
        I currently reside in Rembau, Negeri Sembilan with my mother and sister in the <br>
        occasionally hot, occasionally rainy weather. Playing badminton, reading novels, <br>
        and surfing the internet are three of my favourite pastimes.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align:center">
        I'm now enrolled at the UiTM Negeri Sembilan Branch Rembau Campus. <br>
        Diploma student majoring in Information Management who is now enrolled in <br>
        semester 5 of the final year. Because I'm interested in delving deeper <br>
        into this coding, Web Content Management and Design must be my favourite course.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align:center">
        Sincerely, I can't stay home for too long since I get bored easily. <br>
        I shall therefore hunt for part-time jobs to work during the holidays <br>
        throughout the semester break. Being a kindergarten teacher has so far been <br>
        my favourite job, but that doesn't imply I love kids. <br>
        Because it's simple and enjoyable, I really adore teaching kids!
    </p>
